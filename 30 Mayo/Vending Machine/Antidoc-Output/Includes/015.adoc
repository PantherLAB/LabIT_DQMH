|Master Reference Not Closed
|403687
|The "%s" module cannot be run as singleton because the Master Reference is still open from a prior run as cloneable. If you plan on running this module as both singleton and cloneable, consider changing your Main VI to wire a value of TRUE to the 'Close Master Reference' input of Init Module.vi.
